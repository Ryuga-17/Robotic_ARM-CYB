# Robotic Arm: Material Selection & Assembly Notes

## 🧱 Material Selection

The basic choice was between materials available on **RoboU**:
- **Aluminum 6061 T1**
- **Mild Steel**
- **Stainless Steel 304**

After evaluating **strength vs. weight** along with a proper **trade-off with cost**, **Aluminum 6061 T1** was finalized as the chosen material.

## Tolerances & Feasibility Check

** !!Important:**  
Provide **proper tolerance values** before ordering — missing tolerances create significant **difficulty in assembly** due to interference or misalignment.
